### How to Use ?
Ask test takers to open the ExamGuard app before the exam starts. After opening ExamGuard, students must log in to the application with their Google account. After logging in, the student must first scan the school ID with the camera. Then he can start his exam. If they try to cheat during the exam, ExamGuard will record these moments and notify the instructor. The student who has finished the exam can end the exam with the Finish button after scanning his papers with the camera through the application.
Exam videos of all students and detection of risky moments are recorded on ExamGuard servers. The teacher can enter this server with their own username and password. You can watch cheating attempts and exam videos for each student under the chosen course and exam section.
